        <h2>What Actions Can Be Taken</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to decline the opening of an Account at our discretion.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Your Account may be suspended or terminated for any violation or suspected violation of this Agreement or for valid reasons. Upon Account closure, the entire balance will be remitted to you unless there are grounds for withholding such funds.</p>
        <br />
        <p>While we acknowledge that errors can occur, providing inaccurate information during registration grants us the authority to close your Account and retain any funds within. Similarly, failure to pass personal identification verification procedures will lead to Account closure and the withholding of any winnings.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Opening additional Accounts beyond your first may result in the blocking or closure of said Accounts. If your first Account remains open, any remaining deposits from additional Accounts will be transferred, accompanied by a 10% administrative fee (minimum EUR 50) for each extra Account.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Discovering multiple Accounts registered to a single household empowers us to block or close any related Accounts. Your personal and payment information may be shared with third parties for identity verification purposes.</p>
        <br />
        <p>We do not extend credit, and no interest accrues on your Account balance. We are not to be treated as a financial institution.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Misusing the website to gain money will result in adjustments to your Account to remove any ill-gotten gains, and your Account may face permanent closure.</p>
        <br />
        <p>We reserve the right to refuse, terminate, or limit any bet or wager for any reason.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Bets or stakes may be declared void, and your Account may be closed if we suspect any of the following:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Direct or indirect influence on an event's outcome by you or associated individuals.</li>
            <li>Access to insider knowledge that could impact an event's outcome.</li>
            <li>Engagement in arbitrage or matched betting.</li>
            <li>Violation of the Rules by you or associated individuals.</li>
            <li>Criminal activity affecting an event's outcome.</li>
            <li>Significant odds changes due to public announcements.</li>
            <li>Acceptance of bets due to technical issues or mistakes beyond our control.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <p>Your Account may be closed, winnings withheld, and debits applied if necessary without obligation to provide a reason or notice. Valid contractual obligations at the time of closure will be honored.</p>
        <br />
        <p>In cases of illegal or fraudulent activities, creditor issues, or behavior detrimental to the site, we may freeze or close your Account and/or cancel stakes.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Progressive jackpots are offered for entertainment purposes. Suspected abuse, defined as software-aided play on multiple games simultaneously or cherry-picking games with 'value' jackpots, may result in the suspension or cancellation of game access. In proven abuse cases, all winnings and remaining balances may be confiscated.</p>
        <br />
        <p>All transactions will undergo monitoring and/or review to prevent money laundering.</p>
